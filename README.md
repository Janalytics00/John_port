# [Project 2: HR Analytics for Employee Retention](https://janalytics00.github.io/John_port/Data-Cleaning-In-Pandas-Python)

## Overview of the project ![](assest/HR analysis image.jpg)

#### Introduction:
Employee retention, therefore, stands as one of the most critical challenges organizations face. High attrition rates can lead to increased training and recruitment costs and a reduction in workforce stability.

To address this challenge, I conducted an HR Analytics project intending to identify factors influencing employee attrition and job satisfaction. In this case study, I will present my findings and actionable recommendations.

#### Problem Statement:
_“As the HR department, we aim to analyze employee attrition within our organization to identify contributing factors and develop strategies to improve retention rates. This analysis will help us make data-driven decisions to foster a more engaged and satisfied workforce. We must identify the key factors contributing to employee attrition and develop effective strategies to enhance employee retention and job satisfaction. By doing so, we aim to create a thriving work environment that not only retains our valuable talent but also attracts new talent, positioning us as an employer of choice in the industry.”_

#### What is Employee Attrition?
Employee attrition happens when an employee leaves an organization, be it for voluntary or involuntary reasons and the replacement does not happen for a long period or sometimes never because let's face it two people can not give the same output. Attrition leads to a decrease in the size of an organization or department as the positions are not filled when the employees leave.
Attrition can occur throughout an entire company or just in certain departments or divisions. This typically happens when automation or new technologies replace employees.

#### Questions to Guide Analysis:
- Are there specific departments or job roles experiencing higher attrition rates?
- What demographic factors, such as age, gender, and education level, correlate with attrition?
- Are there patterns in terms of work-related factors, such as overtime, distance from home, or total working years?
- How do employee satisfaction and engagement relate to attrition?

#### Deliverables:
- Summary of the dataset
- Documentation of cleaning and manipulation of the dataset
- Summary of analysis
- Supporting visuals and key findings
- Recommendations based on analysis

#### Overview
Some interesting code/features worked with
```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
HR = pd.read_csv('HR-Employee-Attrition.csv')
HR.head(5)
```

#### Exploratory Data Analysis:
Plotting a Correlation Map Between all the Numerical Value
```python
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Calculating correlation matrix for all numeric variables
numerical_cols = HR.select_dtypes(include=['int64', 'float64']).columns.tolist()
corr_matrix_all = HR[numerical_cols].corr()

# Plotting the correlation matrix for all numeric variables
plt.figure(figsize=(15, 10))
sns.heatmap(corr_matrix_all, annot=True, fmt='.2f', cmap='coolwarm')
plt.title('Correlation Matrix for All Numeric Variables')
plt.show()
```
![](assest/HR analysis image.jpg)

#### Insights:
Total working years and job level have a positive correlation with the attrition rate, which means that employees with more experience and higher job levels are much more likely to leave the organization as they have better job opportunities and higher salaries than the less experienced ones.
Monthly rate and salary hike percentage have a less or negative relationship with attrition as employees who are paid well and given a good salary hike are much less likely to leave the organization.
Job involvement and job satisfaction are highly correlated showing that employees who are involved in their job are satisfied with the job.
The job level is also correlated with the Monthly rate, the number of companies worked, and years at the company, suggesting that higher-level employees are more likely to earn higher salaries, have worked at more companies in the past, and have been with the company for longer.

 [!NOTE]

[View here](HR_Analysis (1).ipynb)

#### Recommendations:
Based on our analysis, we propose the following recommendations:

1. Overtime Management:
Implement measures to manage overtime and ensure employees do not become overburdened. Consider providing flexible work options or additional support for those working overtime.

2. Marital Status Awareness:
Understand the needs and concerns of single employees and address factors that may contribute to higher attrition in this group. This could involve offering more inclusive benefits or programs.

3. Education and Training:
Focus on offering opportunities for further education and skill development, especially for employees with lower education levels. This can improve job satisfaction and retention.

4. Commute-Friendly Policies:
Consider policies or benefits to support employees with long commutes, such as remote work options or transportation assistance.

#### Conclusion:
In conclusion, our HR Analytics project uncovered key insights into the factors affecting employee attrition and job satisfaction. With this knowledge, organizations can take proactive measures to enhance employee engagement, reduce turnover, and create a more satisfying work environment.

By implementing the recommended strategies, organizations can foster a positive workplace culture, leading to increased employee retention and ultimately improving overall business performance.



# [Project 2: Data Cleaning In Pandas Python](https://janalytics00.github.io/John_port/Data-Cleaning-In-Pandas-Python)


## Overview of the project ![](assest/1_QJe_yTA_C8J0UudBRGbYlg.png)

### Overview:
In today's data-driven world, the ability to clean and preprocess data efficiently is essential for extracting valuable insights and building accurate predictive models. In this guide, I will walk you through data cleaning using Pandas, a powerful Python library for data manipulation and analysis. Whether you're a beginner looking to learn the basics or an experienced data scientist seeking advanced techniques, this guide has something for everyone.

#### The dataset shall be cleaned through the following processes:

1. Checking the number of columns.
2. Changing misspelled column names to correct names.
3. Checking for missing values.
4. Checking for duplicate values.
5. Checking for outliers.


#### - Handling Missing Values:
Identify and handle missing values in your dataset using techniques such as imputation, deletion, or interpolation. Pandas provides functions like isnull(), dropna(), and fillna() for this purpose.

- python code
  
print(df.isnull().sum())  # Check for missing values
df.dropna(inplace=True)  # Drop rows with missing values
df['column'].fillna(df['column'].mean(), inplace=True)  # Impute missing values

#### - Removing Duplicates:
Identify and remove duplicate rows from your dataset using the drop_duplicates() function.

- python code
  
df.drop_duplicates(inplace=True)  # Remove duplicate rows

#### - Data Transformation and Feature Engineering:
Perform data transformation and feature engineering to create new variables or modify existing ones based on domain knowledge or analytical requirements.

- python code
  
df['new_column'] = df['old_column'].apply(lambda x: x * 2)  # Create a new column

#### - Handling Outliers:
Identify and handle outliers in your dataset using techniques such as winsorization or trimming.

- python code
  
from scipy.stats import zscore
df['z_score'] = zscore(df['numeric_column'])
df = df[(df['z_score'] < 3) & (df['z_score'] > -3)]  # Remove outliers


#### Conclusion:
Data cleaning is a crucial step in the data analysis process, and Pandas provides powerful tools to handle various data cleaning tasks efficiently. By following the techniques outlined in this guide, you can prepare your data for further analysis and modeling with confidence. Experiment with different methods and explore advanced Pandas functionalities to tailor your data cleaning process to the specific requirements of your dataset.
