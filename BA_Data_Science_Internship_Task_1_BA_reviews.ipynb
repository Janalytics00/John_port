I was given no reason for this. I telephoned BA customer service and must have wasted nearly 2 hours being given wrong phone numbers and incorrect information. Staff need customer training, better knowledge of their product, and some manners. BA customer service was virtually non existent. I will never fly with them again.\",\n          \"LGW-RAK-LGW May 2015. These flights were on BA's newly configured A320's we paid for Emergency Exit row seats on both ways and very thankful that we did British Airways have reduced the legroom in both Economy & Business class to 30\\\" and at 6'1 the normal legroom now is quite tight. The seats themselves are quite comfortable and having storage at the top of the seats mean you don't lose your legroom. The service on board was excellent friendly staff both ways provided with a wrap roll cheese and biscuits and a chocolate mousse both ways return not as nice as outbound and they offer complimentary drinks. Looking at business class all you get is the middle seat free and no extra legroom a lounge and a hot meal so wouldn't think it's worth the upgrade fee anymore (having travelled many times in club with BA new product is not a winner from what I could see). I would fly British Airways again and would recommend them.\",\n          \"Gatwick to Alicante. Crew friendly but a bit amateur for business class Club Europe cabin. Upon boarding I found my row of seats dirty with lollipop stick, empty hankie wrappers, newspaper and empty water bottle all strewn across seat. Aircraft had sat at gate for an hour since landing from Glasgow, why isn't it cleaned and why don't the crew check the state of the business cabin at the very least? Pilot came on the tannoy and said because there were meals being served we had to wait for 6-7 more to be delivered. This delayed the departure by 20 minutes. More afternoon teas were carried on (and crockery). Cue lots of banging and clattering in the forward galley. Crew only offered a drink once which I thought was poor for a business cabin. Not very proactive. Call bell went unanswered twice. I asked for a Baileys and ice to round off the meal when I managed to catch the attention of purser. As duty free trolley rolled back I was handed two bags of nuts instead by another CC.
